About the Project

This project involves Smart Irrigation using IoT and system development through C Programming.  
The core idea of this project is to supply water to the soil based on the moisture content present in the soil and display the moisture level.

By using soil moisture sensors, the system avoids unnecessary water wastage and helps in efficient irrigation management.

Working of the System

The soil moisture sensor is placed in the soil to measure the moisture level.  
If the soil is dry, the sensor sends a signal to the microcontroller and the relay is activated.  
This turns ON the water pump and irrigation starts.

Once the soil reaches sufficient moisture, the pump is switched OFF automatically.

Hardware Implementation

The system is implemented by interfacing the soil moisture sensor with the LPC2148 microcontroller.  
A relay module is used to control the water pump based on sensor readings.

Applications

- Agricultural fields  
- Garden irrigation  
- Small-scale farming  

---

Conclusion

This project helps in reducing water wastage and minimizes manual effort in irrigation.  
It is simple, cost-effective, and suitable for basic smart farming applications.
