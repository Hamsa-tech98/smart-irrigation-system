## ⚙️ Working of the System
1. The soil moisture sensor is placed in the soil to measure the moisture level.
2. If the soil is dry, the sensor sends a signal to the microcontroller.
3. The microcontroller activates the relay module.
4. The relay turns **ON** the water pump, and irrigation begins.
5. Once sufficient moisture is detected, the pump is automatically switched **OFF**.

This process ensures efficient irrigation while preventing water wastage.
